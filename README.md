# Smart-Home-Security-System
Final project of Smart Spaces - Smart Home Security System

This is an android applicaiton to which you can connect cameras that run another code I've posted on my GitHub.

Prerequisites: 
  1) create your google-services.json (via Google) and install it according to google.
  2) connect other cameras (who run another project called "Camera-Client" found in my git repository) by providing their IP address.
  3) enjoy!
